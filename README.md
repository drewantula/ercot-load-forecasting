ERCOT Load Forecasting
Overview

This project explores short-term electricity demand forecasting using historical ERCOT grid data. The objective is to compare baseline time-series methods with machine learning models for hourly load prediction.

Problem Statement

Accurate short-term load forecasting is critical for:

Grid reliability

Energy trading

Renewable integration

Capacity planning

This project evaluates whether machine learning models outperform traditional lag-based forecasting methods.

Methodology (Planned)

Historical ERCOT system load data

Time-series feature engineering (lags, rolling averages, seasonality)

Baseline models (naive + linear regression)

Tree-based ML models (Random Forest / XGBoost)

Evaluation using MAE and RMSE
